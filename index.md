# An Audio Trip fan page

Just a place for some stuff I'd like to write down about the VR rhythm game
(https://audiotripvr.com)[Audio Trip]. It's about the only thing
I use my Oculus Quest for at the moment.


## Add Audio Trip Songs folder to SideQuest

Click the `+` to the right of the existing shortcuts.

Enter these values for the new shortcut:

* Audio Trip
* /sdcard/Android/data/com.KinemotikStudios.AudioTripQuest/files/Songs
* https://hn3000.github.io/audio-trip-stuff/icon/AudioTrip-icon-round@256.png

Then click the green '+' to add the entry.

Use the waffle icon on the left to move the entry to the desired position.

Voil√†!
